      <h1>Comparative Analysis</h1>
    <h2><a href="https://munjoonteo.github.io/wnrs/">We're Not Really Strangers</a></h2>
    <img src="/capstone/images/wnrs.jpg" alt="we're not really strangers">
    <p>In this digital re-creation of the popular card game, We're Not Really Strangers, users take turns answering questions with differing "levels" of intimacy in an effort to get to know each other better. The user interface is simple, and the visual hierarchy is clear with the filled button at the bottom and the current card in the middle of the screen. Although there are instructions about how to play the game, they aren't visible unless the user hovers over them, and the visbility could be improved. Showing the previous cards is a cool idea, but I think it could be displayed in a better way instead of in a scroll. Overall, the user experience was great on desktop, but it isn't mobile friendly.</p>

    <h2><a href="https://www.unlikelycollaborators.com/#questions">Unlikely Collaborators | Perception Box Questions</a></h2>
    <img src="/capstone/images/unlikely-collaborators.jpg" alt="perception box questions">
    <p>Unlikely Collaborators has a similar concept to WNRS which is to answer questions and "get real with one another." Perception Box Questions are also sorted into "levels" although they are called "shallow end," "deep end," and "pain hole" instead of numerical levels.</p>

    <img src="/capstone/images/unlikely-collaborators2.jpg">
        
    <p>The interface is not game-like and could be improved to reduce cognitive load since the scrollable webpage has all of the questions visible in the viewport at once. All of the questions are in bullet points which helps a bit, but it's still somewhat difficult to parse if you are looking away from the screen and back again. There is little to no interaction compared to WNRS, however the overall user experience is still intuitive.</p>
