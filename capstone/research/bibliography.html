        <p class="annotation">One of the reasons for non-adoption of digital technology is lack of interest and a perception of exclusion from the latest technology. To combat this exclusion, end-users need to be involved in the very early stages of the design process. It's important for older adults to participate in a digital economy so that they do not become socially excluded in our rapidly changing world. In several one-on-one interviews, the authors discovered that participants enjoyed the benefits of technology by using “proxies,” in which a family member interfaced with the technology for the interviewee and the technology acted as a mediator; one respondent reported that it was a way to spend time with their family. Older adult users are more likely to accept technology if it is based on a traditional technology that has a clear value and is built on a repository of social stories.</p>

        <p class="annotation">The EVVCC framework provides structure for approaching projects with an informed lens. The framework is broken down into five areas: empathy, values, vision, context, and communication. Some principles for inclusivity outlined include providing a comparable experience, considering the situation, being consistent, giving control, offering choice, prioritizing content, and adding value. Additionally, do's and don'ts of inclusive design may be particularly relevant to older adult users including those with low vision, physical or motor disabilities, and deaf or hard of hearing. It’s important to use good contrast and a readable font, follow a linear, logical layout, and put buttons and notifications in context for those with low vision. For individuals with physical or motor disabilities, it's imperative to make large clickable actions, give form fields space, design for keyboard or speech-only navigation abilities, and provide shortcuts. Those who are deaf or hard of hearing need subtitles or transcripts for video and audio, and the integration of content such as subheadings and images.</p>

        <p class="annotation">Digital technology has the potential to improve older adults' well-being, however, there is a discrepancy between the digital technologies that are developed and what older adults need because of stereotypes that portray them as frail and incompetent. They are excluded from the research and design process and technologies are imposed on them with the intention to “fix” aging which is posed as a “problem”. With the average life expectancy being prolonged, the proportion of older adults aged 65 and above is projected to reach 30% by 2050 in many western countries. In a study conducted about co-designing, focus groups reported having a positive experience with the app that involved them during the ideation phase, and they described feeling empowered and like “partners”.</p>
