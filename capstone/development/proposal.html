        <h1>Capstone Project Proposal</h1>
        <h2>Topic & Audience</h2>
        <p>My topic is about the importance of prioritizing inclusive design for marginalized users.</p>
        <p>There are three target audiences: UX Designers, Corporate CEOs, and Project Stakeholders, all of whom have the power to initiate and reform the industry standard of inclusive design.</p>
        <p>UX Designers can learn about the best practices and design patterns that contribute towards inclusive design, as well as bolster their empathy for the audiences they are designing for.</p>
        <p>Corporate CEOs can reform and invest resources that prioritize design and ensure that designers have a seat at the VP level alongside developers and program managers.</p>
        <p>Project Stakeholders can understand the importance and long-term benefits of inclusive design and why it matters just as much as designing for aesthetics.</p>

        <h2>Game Plan</h2>
        <p>I plan to work on this project solo.</p>

        <h2>Lenses</h2>
        <p>This topic will mostly rely on speculative design, challenging mental models, and data visualization.</p>

        <h2>Features</h2>
        <p>Some of the features that I imagine this project will include are a simulation of a poorly designed interface, and an inclusively designed one. The user will experience the juxtaposition between the two to gain a deeper understanding of the importance of inclusive design.</p>
        <p>I also plan on having some data visualization about the statistics of visual impairments, and what percentage of the population experience it.</p>
        <p>I think it would also be informative to include quotes and anecdotes from individuals with visual impairments.</p>
    </section>

        <h2>Tangents</h2>
        <p>One concern that I have is I am unsure of whether or not to include simulations for disabilities besides visual impairments since it would be difficult to find individuals to interview, and this project has a time constraint.</p>
