        <h1>Capstone Usability Testing Results</h1>
        <h2>Topic & Audience</h2>
        <p>My topic is about the importance of prioritizing inclusive design for marginalized users, more specificcally older adults.</p>
        <p>There are three target audiences: UX Designers, Corporate CEOs, and Project Stakeholders, all of whom have the power to initiate and reform the industry standard of inclusive design.</p>
        <p>UX Designers can learn about the best practices and design patterns that contribute towards inclusive design, as well as bolster their empathy for the audiences they are designing for.</p>
        <p>Corporate CEOs can reform and invest resources that prioritize design and ensure that designers have a seat at the VP level alongside developers and program managers.</p>
        <p>Project Stakeholders can understand the importance and long-term benefits of inclusive design and why it matters just as much as designing for aesthetics.</p>

        <h2>Game Plan</h2>
        <p>I plan to work on this project solo.</p>

        <h2>Lenses</h2>
        <p>This topic will mostly rely on speculative design, challenging mental models, and data visualization.</p>

        <h2>Features</h2>
        <p>Some of the features that I imagine this project will include are a card game which encourages older adults to engage with technology alongside "proxies" or family members that teach them how to interface with the technology. The perceived value of the game comes from its ability to share stories amongst intergenerational family members.</p>
        <p>I may include some data visualization about the statistics of the ageing population.</p>

        <h2>Tangents</h2>
        <p>I plan to co-design with older adults to generate the questions and topics of the cards for the game.</p>
