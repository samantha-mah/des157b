                <p>Our world is constantly evolving, and the myriad of distant possibilities that live in our imagination may very well become our new reality. How might we design for the future?</p>

                <p>The target audience of this project is older adults and their families.</p>

                <p>This project, Tell Me More, aims to spark discussion and foster a safe space for intergenerational families to share their memories, wisdom, and love.</p>

            <h2>Project Research</h2>
            <div class="content">
                <h3>Literature Review</h3>
                <p>I conducted three literature reviews to better understand the following:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>What are the current perceptions of older adults?</li>
                    <li>What does the future look like for the increasing ageing population?</li>
                    <li>How can we design inclusively for older adults?</li>
                </ul>

                <p>The key findings that I derived from my research are that:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Older adults appreciate being included in the design process and one way to do so is through co-designing.</li>
                    <li>Older adults face social exclusion, causing lack of technology adoption. Combatting this involves family members who interface with the technology and serve as proxies.</li>
                    <li>Older adults are more likely to adopt technologies if they follow inclusive design principles and has a clear value with a repository of social stories.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h3>Comparative Research</h3>
            <p>In addition to literature reviews, I also conducted comparative research on two other purpose driven games. The first was We're Not Really Strangers, which is a card game that encourages people to have more meaninful conversations. The second was Perception Box Questions, which aims ot break down barriers between people.</p>

            <h3>Task Flow</h3>
            <img src="../case-study/images/task-flow.jpg">
            <p>I created a task flow to further understand and solifidy how a user would interact with and navigate the project.</p>

                <img src="../case-study/images/font.jpg">
                <p>I created wireframes of the project in Figma before beginning the coding process in order to establish the visual identity of the project.</p>

                <p>For the larger headings, I chose the font Gochi Hands to give the impression of a hand written response, and Reddit Sans was used for all body and paragraph text because of its readability on the web. The primary colors used were orange, pink, and yellow to warmly invite users to share their stories.</p>

                <div class="column">
                    <p>Using the wireframes I created in Figma, I re-created the user interface and made adjustments as I went.</p>

                    <p>One of the larger changes that I made was the results display page. Instead of going for a scrapbook/photo album, I decided to utilize the Animate on Scroll Library to dynamically display the content on the page.</p>

                    <p>A usability choice that I implemented was the ability for the user to toggle the audio on and off. Additionally, I created back buttons so that users can go to the previous question. Visual hierarchy was established through the use of filled buttons to advance to the next question.</p>

                    <p>In order to reduce cognitive load, I split up each question into a different section, one of which is visible at a time.</p>

                <p>Usability testing was conducted to identify pain points and areas of improvement.</p>

                <div class="column">
                    <p>The following actionable feedback was provided:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><h3>Audio feature usability issues.</h3>
                        <p>Users aren't able to turn off audio after clicking anywhere on the page.</p>
                        <p>Allow users to toggle off audio by clicking on a volume button.</p></li>
                    <li><h3>Results display page is not that engaging.</h3>
                        <p>Interaction design can be improved through the use of animations and dynamic transitions.</p>
                        <p>I plan to implement these features using the animation on scroll library to display content on the page one question at a time.</p></li>
                    <li><h3>The share feature requires users to complete an extra step.</h3>
                        <p>The share feature requires users to click on the button, and then manually copy and past the link to share.</p>
                        <p>I plan to update the overlay instead of using the alert feature so that users can click to immediately copy the link.</p></li>
                </ol>

                <p>If I could make further revisions on this project, I would like to add a progress bar to inform users how many questions are left. Additionally, I would like to explore alternative ways to visually display the user's responses.</p>

                <p>Although I faced my fair share of challenges with this project, ultimately, I am proud with how this project turned out.</p>

                <p>Something that I learned by working on this project is the importance of co-designing with target users. Additionally, iteration and being open to feedback was key to the success of this project.</p>

                <p>I am most proud of using databases to store and display each user's responses, and I am also proud of the conceptual depth of the project, which exceeds that of any of my other class projects.</p>

                <p>The most challenging part of this project was figuring out how to store the data in the database and display at the end for each individual user.</p>

                <p>The most rewarding part of this project was working together with my classmates to continually implement new ideas that created an interesting and engaging project.</p>
